This version of Yamba is my adaptation of the Yamba project from the "Learning Android" book written by Marko Gargenta.

The demo app is shown in my Introduction to the Android Application Framework and APIs class for the IEEE Boston Section. It includes
code added by me to implement simple Text To Speech to speak aloud the status text being uploaded to the micro blogging server. It also
includes some changes to the menu items and functionality. Otherwise, it is essentially the final version coming out of the 'journey'
taken through successive chapters of the book.

I plan to update the code to keep up with major upgrades and deprecations to methods that the original code used.
